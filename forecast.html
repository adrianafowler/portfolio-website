              <p>Parents of young children very often feel trapped at home, especially during rainy days. There are many venues which offer activities for children, but searching for them through the internet could be both daunting and tiring for
                busy parents. An Application which gathers information about venues and activities in the local area with the possibility of booking a session straight away, might make parents’ lives easier. What if there could be a possibility to
                filter activities which are relevant to the weather?</p>

              <h4>Competitive analysis:</h4>
              <p>I started by conducting a competitive analysis on three competitors in order to recognise their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities in the market and potential threats. As competitors were focused on one particular type of
                service I spotted an opportunity in offering users more variety in services that could be: <span>WEATHER FORECAST + HOBBIES + FAMILY DAYS OUT + DISCOUNTS AND EASY BOOKING SYSTEM = FORECAST FOR PARENTS</span></p>

          <div class="row">

              <h4>Interviews and surveys:</h4>
              <p>To learn about potential customers, their needs, behaviours, attitudes, frustrations and to validate a concept of Forecast for Parents, I pursued user research studies.
                I conducted five interviews and thirty-five surveys.</p>

              <h4>I found out that:</h4>
              <p>
                Weather has a huge impact on planning days with children and parents need ideas for all kinds of weather, but especially the rain.<br>
                Parents would be happy to have weather updates in the application with activities planning along with hourly weather updates and activities’ updates due to changing weather.<br>

            <p>Parents of school age children are more likely to plan only for the weekends. (This finding clearly narrowed a target group for the application, as the most frequent users would be parents with very young children, up to 5
              years old. However, for other age groups, the product could offer ‘family days out’ ideas.</p>

              <p>Research analysis provided me with solid foundations for creating users personas and journey maps. Personas, who represented a target audience for the app (parents with young children), helped me to understand customers and

              <h4>Journey maps:</h4>
              <p>Journey maps conveyed a visual story of how my personas would work through in order to accomplish their goals.
                Following user stories I set goals, then created steps which personas needed to take in order to achieve their targets.
                (Ideally it should take no more than 3 steps to achieve each goal).In addition, I created emotional journeys, which users potentially would go through during the process.
                Divorced Arthur was focused on planing a family weekend attraction for himself and his daughter. Maria, who has only recently moved, wanted to have an overview on what her new district has to offer for children. Natalie was
                desperately
                looking for attractions for her extremely energetic toddler, during rainy weather.

                architecture. Before creating a site map, I conducted a content audit of the competitor. This completed my knowledge on how information should be categorised in the application. As the user would be able to access each child page
                from different
                parent pages, IA structure for the app fell into category of Co-Existing Hierarchies. After the first draft had been created, site map was refined with potential users, applying a card sorting technique. Below final result:</p>

              <h4>Sketches</h4>
              <p>After user flows and site map were ready, the next stage was to draw sketches of prototypes.
                This method allowed me to transfer concepts and ideas into visual form quickly and amend them easily.
                Minimising details in low fidelity wireframes, helped me to focus only on main functions and features.
                Examples of sketches here show following tasks which would be performed by user: search, book with calendar, set preferences, pay and display ticket.
                Later on in the process, first drafts and concepts will be verified with user testing.</p>
              <h4>Mid and high fidelity wireframes</h4>
              <p>Using previously created sketches as a model, I designed digital low and mid fidelity wireframes.
                In mid fidelity wireframes, I added more details such as buttons, icons, text and other elements.</p>

                <h4>Prototype and User testing:</h4>
                <p>As wireframes were only static representation of an interface, I needed a prototype to portray interactivity between functional elements. I found previously created flows a very useful tool for completing this task.
                  When the prototype was prepared, it was time for user testing.
                  I conducted moderate and remote preference tests.
                  I tested functionality and the most important features of the app, such as: home screen( if it is intuitive and easy to navigate), booking system, reminders, cancellation feature, access to bookings and purchased tickets,
                  preferences, on boarding and sign up.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="col-md-4">
                <!--text column 2-->
                <h4>Preference tests</h4>
                <p>I conducted three preference tests on Usability Hub.
                  There were 15 participants involved in the study. My objective was to test: global navigation placement on home screen, boarding feature and sign up.
                  I provided users with alternatives and asked that they make choices with possible rationale behind them.
                  User responses made a huge impact in the final design outcome.</p>

                <!--text column 3-->
                <h4>Moderate tests</h4>
                <p>Moderate study were held at 20-30 minutes sessions both online and in person. The test included a short briefing and task performance with Forecast for Parents, conducted on a mobile app and desktop resolution. Participants
                  were also asked to express their overall satisfaction with using prototypes and to share heir ideas for possible improvement. From observations and conversations with participants,
                  I managed to uncover two major errors in the prototype: Difficulty with finding access to bookings and booking cancellation.
                  All issues were documented in the rainbow spreadsheet, in which the severity of errors were assigned. Then, in the final report, I highlighted further changes and improvements to be undertaken in the following design process.
                  Overall, participants liked the home screen, found it pleasant to use and easy to navigate. There were no errors made during the booking process.</p>

              <h4>Final screens</h4>
              <div class="col-md-4">
                <!--3columns-->

                <p>As testing results were documented and analysed in ‘Usability Test Report’, there was time to solve problems which participants encountered during testing and to make design more user friendly.
                  Home screen was my priority, so I started with creating a global navbar, which according to test outcome, should be located on the bottom of the screen. Navbar contains quick access icons to tickets, saved (favourites) venues,
                  reminders and personal account.
                  Combining weather forecast with activities display in visual design, in such a way that it doesn’t look cluttered or irrelevant, was one of the biggest challenges. I came up with an idea of placing forecast under the scroll down
                  button as an overlay screen.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="col-md-4">
                <p> Planning feature was one of the concepts for Forecast for Parents, therefore I designed local menu tabs to navigate around days, so users can plan in advance. Home screen displays hourly weather updates along with the most
                  relevant events for that time of the day. If users want to see more offers they can find it under ’show all’ secondary button.
                  ‘Hamburger’ menu is an easy navigation around the app, which gives quick access to the desired time of day
                  Cancellation task was a real frustration for test participants.
                  It was located on the event information screen, so I decided to redesign the way to access this feature. </p>
              </div>

              <div class="col-md-4">
                <p>I placed the cancellation feature under the tickets icon.
                  As previously mentioned, test participants helped me to shape information on the event screen. Now, the event information screen displays:
                  time and age relevance, location of the event, price, information about restaurants, accessibility information and facilities, opening times, prices, information about providers, developmental benefits for each activity, access
                  to other dates and booking from calendar feature.
                </p>

                      <h4>Did I solve the problem?</h4>


                    <p>I created a design for an application which provides parents with updates on events for children in their local area.<br>
            I implemented weather forecast in the design.</p>

                  <h4>What went well?</h4>
                  <p>User research provided me with complex knowledge and great foundations for the design.</p>

                  <ul>
                    <!--second small list within big list-->
                    <li>Skills: Conducting interviews and surveys</li>
                    <li>Process: UX research</li>
                    <li>Solution: Well prepared questions and relevant target group can bring great solutions for the problem.</li>
                    <li>User testing helped me to verify first draft.</li>
                    <li>Skills: User testing methods, user- centred approach.</li>
                    <li>Process: Creating a prototype, recruiting participants, preparing questions and scenarios, conducting a study, gathering and analysing results.</li>
                    <li>Solution: Great source of information for the design improvement.</li>
                  </ul>

            </div>

                  <h4>What didn't go well?</h4>
                  <p>User flows should be shorter and should represent only one task performed by user. For each flow I should have created a sketch which represents a low fidelity prototype. This method would definitely make the design easier.
                    I implemented this technique in my next design and it worked perfectly.
                    Some of features were too confusing for test participants, so they were redesigned to be clearer for potential users.</p>

                <h4>How my design addresses user’s needs?</h4>


                  <p>Easy and intuitive to navigate home screen and booking system, complete information about event, freedom in shaping home screen content,
                    personal preferences and personal profile, providing idea’s dependant on weather.<br>
                    My first draft of the home screen had displayed offers first and then a list of relevant events,
                    but after I realised that the main purpose of the application wasn’t selling offers, but providing parents with ideas for their children in relation to the weather I decided to make changes in the design.<br>
                    I created a home screen which has vertical timeline made of horizontal carousels. Each carousel displays the most relevant events for a particular time of the day. I provided users with the freedom of setting their own preferences and shape their home
                    screen. <br>The weather filter can be switched on/off and the user can choose days of the week that they are interested in, age relevance, or change location and distance. Favourite venues can be saved and user can track other
                    offers from that provider.<br>
                    I also provided an additional feature for hourly weather updates and a more detailed forecast under the scroll down button.<br>
                    Quick access to reminders, tickets, saved venues and personal account from the bottom nav bar makes navigation easier.<br>
                    Search feature is also included and provides greater freedom.</p>

                  <h4>What could be improved?</h4>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Perform more than one round of user testing and use a higher number of participants.</li>
                    <li>To work more on UI design.</li>
                  </ul>




                  <h4>What would be next?</h4>



              <p>If I was going to continue my work on this project my next steps would be:<br>
                Designing an interface for events’ organisers - venues, so they can create an account and sell their services through the app.<br>
                Designing review system for parents, so they could leave reviews and rate venues.<br>
                Add more information about restaurants and bars with children’s menu.</p>
